Inner Classes: (Nest classes)
=============
In Java, it is also possible to nest classes (a class within a class). The purpose of nested classes is to group classes that 
belong together, which makes your code more readable and maintainable.
Rule1: To access the inner class, create an object of the outer class, and then create an object of the inner class
======
Rule2:Unlike a "regular" class, an inner class can be private or protected. If you don't want outside objects to access the inner class, 
======
declare the class as private.
