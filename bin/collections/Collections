The Java collections framework provides a set of interfaces and classes to implement various data structures and algorithms.

LinkedList: Class - provides implementation of doubly linked data structure

Collection Interface: root interface of the java collections framework.
No direct implementation.
Implemented through sub-interfaces like List,Set,Queue.

1. List Interface: Ordered collection - that allows to add and remove elements like an array.
==================
2. Set Interface: Allows to store elements in different sets similar to the set in mathematics.
=================
No duplicates allowed.
3. Queue Interface: When we want to store and retrieve elements in FIFO manner.
===================
4. Map Interface: allows elements to be stored in key-value pairs. 
=================
Keys should be unique and can be used to access a particular element in a map.
Each key has a single value associated with it.
Common methods available in all sub-interfaces:
add(),addAll(),size(),remove(),removeAll(),iterator(),clear().
5. Iterator Interface: Provides method that can be used to access elements of collections.

Collections Framework vs Collection Interface: 
Collection Interface: Root interface of all collections framework.
Collection Framework: The framework includes all the interfaces,sub-interfaces and classes to implement various data structures 
and algorithms.

SubInterfaces: Collection interface includes sub-interfaces like(list,set,queue,iterator and map) that are implemented by 
corresponding Java classes.
