Access Specifiers/Modifiers:
* Is used to facilitate encapsulation.
 * There are two types of modifiers in Java: access modifiers and non-access modifiers.
 * The access modifiers in Java specifies the accessibility or scope of a field, method, constructor, or class. 
 * The access modifiers in Java helps to restrict the scope of a class, constructor, variable, method, or data member.
 * We can change the access level of fields, constructors, methods, and class by applying the access modifier on it.
 

* There are four types of access modifiers available in java: 
1. Default – No keyword required
2. Private
3. Protected
4. Public

								Default			Private			Protected		Public
Same Class						Yes				Yes				Yes				Yes
Same Package-Subclass			Yes				No				Yes				Yes
Same Package-Non Subclass		Yes				No				Yes				Yes
Diff Package-Subclass			No				No				Yes				Yes
Diff Package-Non Subclass		No				No				No				Yes

Decreasing order of strictness:
Private   Within the class
Default   Within the package
Protected Within the package and subclass of different package
Public    Everywhere

Package: collection of related classes / grouping of related classes. The code becomes organized.

Default: When no access modifier is specified for a class, method, or data member – It is said to be having the default access modifier by default. 
The data members, class or methods which are not declared using any access modifiers i.e. having default access modifier are accessible only within the same package.

Private: The private access modifier is specified using the keyword private. 
The methods or data members declared as private are accessible only within the class in which they are declared.
Any other class of the same package will not be able to access these members.
Top-level classes or interfaces can not be declared as private because
private means “only visible within the enclosing class”.
protected means “only visible within the enclosing class and any subclasses”.

protected: The protected access modifier is specified using the keyword protected.
The methods or data members declared as protected are accessible within the same package or subclasses in different packages.

public: The public access modifier is specified using the keyword public. 
The public access modifier has the widest scope among all other access modifiers.
Classes, methods, or data members that are declared as public are accessible from everywhere in the program. There is no restriction on the scope of public data members.
