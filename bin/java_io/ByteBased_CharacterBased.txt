Benefits of Byte Stream:
========================
1.Byte stream provides a convenient way to handle the input and output of bytes.
2.If your file is too large, byte stream handles data in chunks rather than having the entire data altogether in the memory.
3.They are useful when we want to read/write binary data.

Benefits of Character Stream:
=============================
1.Character stream provides convenient means to handle character-based inputs and outputs.
2.Since they use Unicode, Character streams can be internationalized. Internationalization is the process of preparing an application 
that supports linguistic, regional, cultural or political-specific data.
3.In some cases, character streams are more efficient than byte streams especially when the file contains characters.
4.Character streams automatically translate the internal format of the file (the content of the file) to and from the local character 
set without extra effort by the programmer.
5.In short, character streams make it easy to write programs that are not dependent upon a specific character encoding, 
which becomes easy to internationalize.
