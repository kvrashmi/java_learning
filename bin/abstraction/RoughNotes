1. Have an abstract class
2. Have a derived class - derived class should extend the abstract class
3. Main method is in derived class
4. Try to create an object of the abstract class - it wont work.
RuleNo5: We cannot create object or instantiate an abstract class
1. Have an abstract class
2. Main method is inside this abstract class itself
3. Try to create an object of this abstract class - it wont work.

4. We can also have static methods.


1. You downloaded my code from master branch
2. You create a new branch - git branch -m "branchname"

4. Write the code
5. Push the code (from local branch - to your remote branch)
6. give me a pull request (go to git hub - open rashmi's account - there you should privide the pull request)
7. (Duncan's) branchhame =>(rashmi's) master
