Literal: Any constant value which can be assigned to the variable is called literal/constant. 
Literals in Java is a synthetic representation of boolean, numeric, character, or string data. 
It is a medium of expressing particular values in the program.

For Integral data types (byte, short, int, long), we can specify literals in 4 ways:- 
Decimal literals (Base 10):
===========================
In this form, the allowed digits are 0-9.
int x = 101;

Octal literals (Base 8):
======================== 
In this form, the allowed digits are 0-7.
The octal number should be prefix with 0.
int x = 0146; 

Hexa-decimal literals (Base 16): In this form, the allowed digits are 0-9, and characters are a-f. 
================================
We can use both uppercase and lowercase characters as we know that java is a case-sensitive programming language,
but here java is not case-sensitive.
The hexa-decimal number should be prefix with 0X or 0x.
int x = 0X123Face; 

Binary literals: From 1.7 onward, we can specify literal value even in binary form also, allowed digits are 0 and 1. 
===============
Literals value should be prefixed with 0b or 0B.
int x = 0b1111;

By default, every literal is of int type, we can specify explicitly as long type by suffixed with l or L. 
There is no way to specify byte and short literals explicitly but indirectly we can specify. 
Whenever we are assigning integral literal to the byte variable and if the value is within the range of byte then the compiler treats 
it automatically as byte literals.
