		 * Rules:
	 	 * A variable name can consist of Capital letters A-Z, lowercase letters a-z digits 0-9, and two special characters such as _ underscore and $ dollar sign.
		 * The first character must not be a digit.
         * Blank spaces cannot be used in variable names.
		 * Java keywords cannot be used as variable names.
         * Variable names are case-sensitive.
         * There is no limit on the length of a variable name but by convention, it should be between 4 to 15 chars.
         * Variable names always should exist on the left-hand side of assignment operators.
