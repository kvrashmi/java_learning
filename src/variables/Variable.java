	 Instance Variables - variables declared inside a class are called Instance variable.
	 They are otherwise known as non-static variables.
	 They are not declared within a method or constructor or block.
	 They are created when an object is created and destroyed when an object is destroyed.
	 They can be accessed only by creating objects of their respective class.
	 Unlike local variables, we may use access specifiers for instance variables. 
	 If we do not specify any access specifier, then the default access specifier will be used.
	 Initialization of an instance variable is not mandatory. Its default value is 0.
	 Declare them outside the class methods.
	 Access specifier does not affect the scope of them with in the class.

	/* 2. Static Variables
	 These variables are declared similarly as instance variables. 
	 The difference is that static variables are declared using the static keyword within a class outside of any method, constructor or block.
     Unlike instance variables, we can only have one copy of a static variable per class, 
     irrespective of how many objects we create.
     Static variables are created at the start of program execution and destroyed automatically when execution ends.
	 Initialization of a static variable is not mandatory. Its default value is 0.
     If we access a static variable like an instance variable (through an object), the compiler will show a warning message, which wonâ€™t halt the program. 
     The compiler will replace the object name with the class name automatically.
	 If we access a static variable without the class name, the compiler will automatically append the class name.
