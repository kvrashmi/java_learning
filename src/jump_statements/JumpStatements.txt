=========
When a continue statement is encountered the control directly jumps to the beginning of the loop for the next iteration instead of 
executing the statements of the current iteration. The continue statement is used when we want to skip a particular condition and 
continue the rest execution. Java continue statement is used for all type of loops but it is generally used in for, while, and do-while loops.
In the case of for loop, the continue keyword force control to jump immediately to the update statement.
Whereas in the case of a while loop or do-while loop, control immediately jumps to the Boolean expression.

Break:
======
Break Statement is a loop control statement that is used to terminate the loop. 
As soon as the break statement is encountered from within a loop, the loop iterations stop there, and control returns from the loop 
immediately to the first statement after the loop. 
Basically, break statements are used in situations when we are not sure about the actual number of iterations for the loop 
or we want to terminate the loop based on some condition.  
Break: In Java, the break is majorly used for: 
==============================================
Terminate a sequence in a switch statement (discussed above).
To exit a loop.
Used as a “civilized” form of goto.
In the case of nested loops, the break statement terminates the innermost loop.
