1.Declaring constructor as final
================================
In inheritance whenever you extend a class,the child class inherits all the members of the superclass except the constructors.
In other words, constructors cannot be inherited in Java, therefore, you cannot override constructors.
So, writing final before constructors make no sense. Therefore, java does not allow final keyword before a constructor.
If you try, make a constructor final a compile-time error will be generated saying “modifier final not allowed here”.
