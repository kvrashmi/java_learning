Encapsulation:
==============
1. Encapsulation refers to the bundling of fields and methods inside a single class.

Data Hiding:
===========
2. Data Hiding/ Data Abstraction can be achieved through encapsulation: It prevents outer classes from accessing and 
changing fields and methods of a class. This also helps to achieve data hiding.
How to achieve data-hiding through getters-setters:
===================================================
3. Declare all the instance variables/properties/attributes of a class as final.
4. Declare all the methods of the class as public.
5. Try to access the private (instance variables/properties/attributes) through the public methods.
Hint: Getters-Setters
====
The getter and setter methods provide read-only or write-only access to our class fields.
