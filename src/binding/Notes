Binding: Connecting a method call to a method body is known as binding.
=======
Two Types of binding:
=====================
1. Static binding (early binding): 
when type of the object is determined at compile time
If there is any private, final or static method in a class, there is static binding.
2. Dynamic binding (late binding): when type of the object is determined at run-time.
