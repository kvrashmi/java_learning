ArrayList: 
class to implement functionality of resizable-arrays.
Implements list interface of collections framework.

ArrayList vs Array:
Array : Declare the size first and then use it. 
Once size is declared it cannot be changed.
ArrayList: Allows us to create resizable arrays. 
Automatically adjust size when we add or remove elements from them. 
Hence, arraylists are known as dynamic arrays.

How to create an arraylist:

import java.util.ArrayList;

ArrayList<String> al1 = new ArrayList<String>();
ArrayList<Integer> al2 = new ArrayList<Integer>();

List<Double> al3 = new ArrayList<Double>(); 
List<ClassType> al4 = new ArrayList<ClassType>();


ArrayList class implements all the methods in the List interface.
Despite that it has its own set of methods.
