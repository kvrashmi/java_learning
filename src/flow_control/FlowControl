Flow Control:
A programming language uses control statements that control the flow of execution of a program based on certain conditions.
These are used to cause the flow of execution to advance and branch based on changes to the state of a program. 

1.if:
	if statement is the most simple decision-making statement. It is used to decide whether a certain statement or block of statements 
will be executed or not i.e if a certain condition is true then a block of statement is executed otherwise not. 
Syntax: 
		if(condition) 
		{
		   // Statements to execute if
		   // condition is true
		}
Here, the condition after evaluation will be either true or false. if statement accepts boolean values – if the value is true then it will execute the block of statements under it. 
If we do not provide the curly braces ‘{‘ and ‘}’ after if( condition ) then by default if statement will consider the immediate one statement to be inside its block. For example, 

if(condition)
   statement1;
   statement2;

// Here if the condition is true, if block 
// will consider only statement1 to be inside 
// its block.

2.if-else: The if statement alone tells us that if a condition is true it will execute a block of statements and if the condition is false it
 won’t. But what if we want to do something else if the condition is false. Here comes the else statement. We can use the else statement 
 with if statement to execute a block of code when the condition is false. 

Syntax: 

	if (condition)
	{
    	// Executes this block if
    	// condition is true
	}
	else
	{
    	// Executes this block if
    	// condition is false
	}
